/**
 * Database Schemas:
 * 
 * The plugin uses two custom database schemas: story_schema and user_preferences_schema.
 * 
 * The story_schema defines the structure of a story, including fields for a short description, narrative style, sharpness level, and experience level.
 * 
 * The user_preferences_schema defines the structure of user preferences, which are used to generate personalized stories.
 */

/**
 * Functionality:
 * 
 * The plugin provides the following main features:
 * 
 * - ACF Pro Integration: Uses ACF Pro to create custom fields for stories and user preferences.
 * - AI-driven Storytelling: Integrates an AI library or service to generate stories based on user inputs. The AI can consider different narrative styles and themes.
 * - Custom Post Type 'story': Stories are stored in the custom post type 'story'. Authors can specify a short description, narrative style, sharpness level, and experience level.
 * - Gamification Elements: Introduces reward systems, progress bars, and badges. Users can earn points by reading, sharing, or rating stories.
 * - Interactive Notifications: Users receive notifications about new stories, rewards, or updates. Notifications are sent both in the dashboard and by email.
 * - Data Validation: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to minimize security risks.
