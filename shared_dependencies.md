Shared Dependencies:

1. **ACF JSON Configurations**: All the JSON files (post_types.json, taxonomies.json, options_pages.json) share the dependency of ACF JSON configurations. These configurations are used to define the structure and behavior of custom post types, taxonomies, and options pages.

2. **WordPress Functions**: All PHP files (CustomPostTypes.php, Taxonomies.php, OptionsPages.php, ACFIntegration.php, intimate-tales-acf-integration.php) will use WordPress functions for creating and managing custom post types, taxonomies, and options pages.

3. **ACF Pro Functions**: All PHP files will also use ACF Pro functions for integrating ACF with WordPress and managing ACF JSON configurations.

4. **Plugin Namespace**: All PHP files will share the same namespace, likely something like `IntimateTales_ACF_Integration`, to avoid naming conflicts.

5. **Class Names**: The class names `CustomPostTypes`, `Taxonomies`, `OptionsPages`, and `ACFIntegration` will be shared across the PHP files as they represent the main functionality of the plugin.

6. **Method Names**: Method names for creating, managing, and integrating ACF configurations will be shared across the PHP files. These might include methods like `create_post_type`, `define_taxonomy`, `construct_options_page`, etc.

7. **File Paths**: The paths to the JSON files will be shared across the PHP files as they need to load these configurations.

8. **WordPress Coding Standards**: All PHP files will adhere to the same WordPress coding standards for consistency and readability.

9. **Documentation**: All PHP files will share the same documentation standards, including class, method, and integration point descriptions.
