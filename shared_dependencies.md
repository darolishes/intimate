Shared Dependencies:

1. **WordPress Core**: All files will depend on the WordPress core for basic functionalities and APIs. 

2. **PHP**: As the primary language, PHP will be used across all files.

3. **ACF Plugin**: The Advanced Custom Fields plugin will be a shared dependency for the `acf_integration.php` and `settings_management.php` files.

4. **IntimateTales Settings Plugin**: This plugin will be a shared dependency for the `settings_management.php` file.

5. **API Endpoints and Hooks**: These will be shared across `integration_points.php`, `api_hooks.php`, and potentially other files to allow for interoperability.

6. **Function Names**: Functions such as `initialize()`, `configure()`, `register_hooks()`, etc. will likely be shared across multiple files for initializing, configuring, and registering hooks respectively.

7. **Data Schemas**: Shared data schemas may include user settings, plugin configurations, and custom field definitions. These will be used in `settings_management.php` and `acf_integration.php`.

8. **DOM Element IDs**: If any JavaScript is used, DOM element IDs such as `#settings-form`, `#acf-fields`, etc. may be shared across files.

9. **Message Names**: Shared message names for communication between plugins and modules may include `settings_updated`, `acf_field_added`, etc.

10. **Modular Architecture**: The concept of modular architecture will be shared across all files, as each file represents a separate module of the plugin.
